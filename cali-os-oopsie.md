# california to ban minors from using computers without parental permission

[Assembly Bill No. 1043](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1043) became law on October 13, 2025 and will go into effect in California, United States, on January 1st 2027.

Here are two excerpts from the bill's text:

> This bill ... would require ... an operating system provider ... to provide an accessible interface at account setup that requires an account holder ... to indicate the birth date, age, or both, of the user of that device

> “Account holder” means an individual who is at least 18 years of age or a parent or legal guardian of a user who is under 18 years of age in the state.

Let's consider the implication of these statements for a moment.

If an OS provider is **required** to collect certain information from an "account holder" on setup, and an "account holder" **cannot** be under the age of 18, then the OS provider **must** deny access to anyone under the age of 18 who does not have an overseeing "account holder" or risk breaking the law and being subject to a $2500 fine per instance.

(Incidentally, the bill is written in such a way that "account holder" clearly means "the person with the Microsoft or Apple account", because that is the only way any of the people who wrote it have ever interacted with a computer in their lives.)

This is dumb. And bad. And could very easily be used as legal justification to ban open-source operating systems in the state.
